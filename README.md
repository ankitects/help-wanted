Anki moved away from a public issue tracker years ago, because the majority of posts on it were actually support requests, and it was easier to triage them on a dedicated support site (https://help.ankiweb.net). But there was a downside - it became harder for people who want to contribute to Anki to be aware of issues that need fixing. This repo is an experiment to see if it's practical to keep a public list of issues that others might want to tackle, while keeping support to the support site.

PLEASE DO NOT POST NEW BUG REPORTS / FEATURE REQUESTS HERE. Please post on the [support site](https://help.ankiweb.net), and if I'm unable to fix your issue myself in a reasonable timeframe and think it's a good candidate for this list, I'll add a post here.

Comments on existing posts are welcome, and PRs which address the issues here would be most appreciated. :-)
